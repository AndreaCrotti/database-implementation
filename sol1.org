   - *Physical Data Independence*
   - *Logical Data Independence*
   - *Block and page*
   - *Asynchronous I/O*
   - *Blocking I/O*
   - *Block I/O*
   - *Access path*
   - *Query*

2. Buffer management
   - *Why should be the DMBS in charge of buffering*

   - *Benefits of copying their own pages out the buffer spool in long processing threads*

   - *What to do in case avarage I/O consuming rate is much larger than disk reading rate?*
     
3. Database architecture
   - *Five layers of database architecture, concepts handled by them and interfaces between layers*

   - *Sort the tasks in top-down manner*
     + buffering
     + logical relation and cursor management
     + media access
     + access path management
     + view formulation and management

   - *Why this architecture not fully implemented in databases?*

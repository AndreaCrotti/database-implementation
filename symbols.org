Latex for org-(ab)users
[[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf][list of all latex symbols]]

* Some symbols
| \sigma | =\sigma= |
| \pi    | =\pi=    |
| \Join  | =\Join=  |
| \in    | =\in=    |
| \wedge | =\wedge= |
| \vee   | =\vee=   |

* Arguments
  Sometimes you need to give arguments to functions.
  In general we use =_= for lower indexes, =^= for exponents and () for arguments.
  When you have multiple arguments in the index or the exponent put them together with {}.
  
  For example:

| \log_x^2              | =\log_x^2=              |
| \sigma_{A,B}(\pi_C R) | =\sigma_{A,B}(\pi_C R)= |
  

# * Formulas
#   When you're writing formulas you should use the $$ as in latex.
  
#   See for example the difference between
  
#   \sin(x) * 2 : =\sin(x) * 2=
  
#   and 
#   $\sin(x) * 2$ : =$\sin(x) * 2$=

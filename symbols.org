[[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf][list of all latex symbols]]

* Some symbols
| \sigma      | =\sigma=      |
| \pi         | =\pi=         |
| \Join       | =\Join=       |
| \in         | =\in=         |
| \notin      | =\notin=      |
| \wedge      | =\wedge=      |
| \vee        | =\vee=        |
| \exists     | =\exists=     |
| \nexists    | =\nexists=    |
| \forall     | =\forall=     |
| \rightarrow | =\rightarrow= |
| \leftarrow  | =\leftarrow=  |

* Arguments
  Sometimes you need to give arguments to functions.
  In general we use =_= for lower indexes, =^= for exponents and () for arguments.
  When you have multiple arguments in the index or the exponent put them together with {}.
  
  For example:

  | \log_x^2              | =\log_x^2=              |
  | \sigma_{A,B}(\pi_C R) | =\sigma_{A,B}(\pi_C R)= |


* Quoting
  Latex has some key characters that have a special meaning.
  If you want to insert those characters you have to quote them with "\".
  So for example.
  | \pi_{\{A,B\}} | =\pi_{\{A,B\}}= |
  
  Here one { is quoted and will be inserted as it is and the other is used to join the arguments.

* Equations
  Things are getting more complicated here.

# * Formulas
#   When you're writing formulas you should use the $$ as in latex.
  
#   See for example the difference between
  
#   \sin(x) * 2 : =\sin(x) * 2=
  
#   and 
#   $\sin(x) * 2$ : =$\sin(x) * 2$=

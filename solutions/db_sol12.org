* Exercise 12.1

** 1. (0,1,P), (0,2,P), (2,0,D), (1,0,R), (0,2,A), (0,1,A)

** 2. 12

** 3. 24

** 4. 6

** 5. (2n! * n!)/2^n

* Exercise 12.2

** 1.
// we have it in last year exercise 7.3. please type it in? :P

** 2.

** 3. First we do the projection of r on Y, then ship the projection result to site B.
Then we do natural join of the projection and relation s, then we get a reduction of s with respect to r.
Then we ship the reduction of s to site A, and compute the natural join of the reduction and r.

The total transmition is the size of the tuples of the projection on Y in r, plus the size of the reduction of s with respect to r.

* Exercise 9.1[Tableau Containment] :
  - D1 :{<a1,a2> | \exists b1 \exists b2(R(a1,b1) \wedge R(b2,a2) \wedge R(b1,5) \wedge R(5,b2))} \\
  - D2 :{<a1,a2> | \exists b1 \exists b2\exists b3\exists b4(R(a1,b2) \wedge R(a1,b4) \wedge R(b1,a2) \wedge R(b2,b3) \wedge R(b4,b3) \wedge R(b3,b1))}

# Also add the result row somehow, not sure that it is so simple

*** T1
    | a1 | a2 |
    |----+----|
    | a1 | b1 |
    | b2 | a2 |
    | r1 | 5  |
    | 5  | b2 |
    |----+----|
    | 5  | 5  |

*** T2
    | a1 | a2 |
    |----+----|
    | a1 | b2 |
    | a1 | b4 |
    | b1 | a2 |
    | b2 | b3 |
    | b4 | b3 |
    | b3 | b1 |

** 2.
   To check if one is included in the other we must check that:
   - T1, T2 have the same columns and entries in result rows.
   - the relation computed from T1 is a subset of the one from T2 for all valid assignments of relations to rows.

*** T1 \subseteq T2:

# Insert here the text of   

** 1.
   
#+begin_src sql
   SELECT gift.name, supplier.name, COUNT(*)
   FROM gift, supplier, shipment
   WHERE shipment.gift = gift.gift_id AND shipment.supplier = supplier.supplier_id
   AND gift.price > 190 AND supplier.place IN
   (SELECT DISTINCT place.place_id
   FROM employee, place
   WHERE employee.place = place.place_id AND employee.nationality = ’German’ )
   GROUP BY gift.name, supplier.name
#+end_src

*** a) The selection (IN expression) on supplier.place

*** b) The selection on git.price

*** c) The join on shipment.gift and gift.gift_id

*** d) The join on shipment.supplier and supplier.supplier_id

*** e) The join on employee.place and place.place_id

** 2. Sketch a query plan for this query that would result in the minimum amount of work given no indices and the selectivity estimates you gave above.

** 3. Reccommend a set of indices that will improve the performance of this query at most

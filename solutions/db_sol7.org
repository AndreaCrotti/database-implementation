* Exercise 7.1
  Given two relations R(x, y) and S(y, z) and the following data:
  - T(R) = 1000
  - T(S) = 600
  - V(R, Y) = 150
  - V(S, Y) = 40
  - min(R.y) = min(S.y) = 0 and max(R.y) = max(S.y) = 200
  Where V(R, A) is the number of distinct numbers of attribute A in relation R
  
** 1. If we assume uniform distribution, what is the selectivity of each of the expressions?
   

** 2. If the database holds a histogram of the relations as follows, what are the selectivities?

** 3. What are the error rates of the first estimation against the second?
